# AttendanceView

AngularJS view-only app that shows the vacation/sick days taken by area.  I created this based on Steve Michelotti's example app
that he builds in his Pluralsight course AngularUI Fundamentals, which I highly recommend(he builds a game scheduling application and mine is for viewing vacation and sick days at work).  In his example he used Azure Mobile Services 
and in my app I used SQL Server and stored procedures.  I did this to fit in with my current work environment.  To setup the 
database I used in this app run the SQL script in the DatabaseScript folder but first change the filename in lines 7 and 9.  Then 
change the database connection string under Settings in Properties.

In Steve's course he created a much more elaborate application that allowed data modification.  In this app I first wanted to created a 
simple application that got me familiar with the basic concepts.
